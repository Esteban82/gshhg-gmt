It has been decided that 2.3.7 is the last 2.3.x series of the GSHHG files
distributed as polygons (binary and shapefiles).  The reason is that it is
just too much manual work to add new full-resolution polygons and derive
lower-resolution versions that do not self-intersect or intersect other
polygons.  We may still continue to update the full-resolution polygons
and make new netcdf tiles for GMT but will no longer issue the bin and
shp versions.

If you are a guru and wish to make changes of some sort to the GSHHG polygons or WDBII lines,
cd to src and read GSHHG_updating.html for further instructions.
