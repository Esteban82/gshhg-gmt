July 7, 2011: Remember that Level_05 is just a legacy file.  We used
	it to extract the closed river-lake polygons in 2009 but it
	also has some odd features that don't fit.  Our tools explicitly
	skips level 5 when producing binary files for GSHHS and GMT.
	All river-lakes are in their own level 00 file.  Thus, there
	is no point editing the Level_05 file.
