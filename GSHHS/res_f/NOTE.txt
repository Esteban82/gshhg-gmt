On Jan 2, 2020 I split the largets file GSHHS_f_Level_1.txt into two files:

GSHHS_f_Level_1a.txt
GSHHS_f_Level_1b.txt

of approximately equal length (not size) so that the repo would fit in GitHub.
Developers needing to run the gshhg tools will need to stitch these back together
or modify the software to do so in the code.
