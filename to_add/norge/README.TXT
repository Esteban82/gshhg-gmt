# See emails from birgitterf@met.no regarding two missing islands
near Aalesund, Norway.  She sent us a file from Kartverket that is
about the same resolution as GSHHG but GSHHG is likely shifted by
~500 m west and south.  To use their data I had to add this shift
so that the new islands would not cross other GSHHG features...
So please add the two islands in the file two_missing_islands.txt.

2017-06-08 P.Wessel: The islands have been added to 2.3.7-pre and
things are working.
